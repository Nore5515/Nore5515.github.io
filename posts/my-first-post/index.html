<h1>Starting Out</h1>
<p>23/01/20</p>
<p>Well, after a long week and a half, I finally have this blog up and running. Hopefully. I'm not entirely sure if this will work, but I'm remaining optimistic, as I have for the past 10 days or so.</p>
<p>This blog is hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, and through using them I realized I had forgotten practically everything I had ever known about git. It took me almost an entire day, but I relearned some git commands, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pulling, committing and pushing to and from a repo</li>
<li>Setting upstream, head, branches, SSH-keys and forks</li>
<li>Merging, and fixing said merge errors</li>
<li><strong>S u b m o d u l e s</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Submodules gave me a hard time. I persisted, I emerged victorious, but I left that experience a different person than when I went in.</p>
<p>The blog itself is using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> for its framework, and I must admit, I've grown rather fond of it. It's a static site generator, which is why I'm hosting it on github pages right now, and runs incredibly quickly with some very user friendly commands. However, I struggled a lot with getting it to work with Github Pages. Following the Hugo to Github Pages tutorial (posted <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">here</a>), I ran into a lot of issues getting Hugo's public folder to be its own submodule, but eventually (with some help) got it fixed.</p>
<p>Another nice thing about Hugo is it's wide selection of easy to use themes! I'm using <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/papercss-hugo-theme/">Paper CSS</a> right now, and I'm pleased to say that it gave me no trouble whatsoever when I was adding it.</p>
<p>I learned a lot through this whole experience, specifically about web dev, something I've never touched in the past (the most experience I had with this sort of thing was a 3 hour HTML course in middle school. I spent two of those three hours playing <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a> on the school computers). With some new experience in hand, I'm excited to start creating and developing more and more web stuff. All in all, things are looking up!</p>
